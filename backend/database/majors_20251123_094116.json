      "description": "Exploratory Studies is a program designed for students who are undecided about their academic path, allowing them to discover their interests before committing to a specific field. Students typically take a broad range of introductory courses across various disciplines such as humanities, sciences, arts, and business. The primary outcome is to help students make an informed decision and declare a permanent major, which then determines their ultimate career path. This major provides a structured environment with dedicated advising to guide students toward a fulfilling academic and professional future.",
